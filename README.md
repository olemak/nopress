Use WordPress as CMS, but ditches all the opinionated wordpress stuff in order to make super-fast, static file based asynchronous single-page sites.

Not really working on this any more, as I switched to React - so check out ReactPress, which aims to do the same, but with React.js and Redux instad of vanilla js.
